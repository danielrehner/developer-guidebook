# Build assets, not one-offs.

Don't just answer a teammate's question. Create a wiki page with the question and answer.

Don't just create a script or [gist](https://gist.github.com/) to do something.
Get it into source control.
Better yet, build the function you need into your app.
Create things that can be reused by you and others.

The principles of [temporal and spacial locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference) suggest that if something happened at a certain place and time,
that thing is very likely to happen again relatively soon in that same place.
When you're creating that one-off bit of code, remember: you're likely to need that thing again in the not-too-distant future.
Challenge yourself to put in just a little extra energy to solve the problem or meet the need in a way that can be reused.
