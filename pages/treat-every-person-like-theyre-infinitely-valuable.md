# Treat every person like they're infinitely valuable. 

Every person is one-of-a-kind.
They have a unique position in society and time that no one else can occupy.
As such, they have the theoretical potential to make significant, unique contributions.

No one can be a son or daughter to their parents the way they can.
No one can be a brother or sister to their syblings the way they can.
No one can be a friend to their friends the way they can.
No one can be a parent or mentor to the younger people around them in the same way they can.

No one else could make those same contributions at the same time and place and in the same way that they could.
Each of their contributions can improve their environment and the lives of the people around them.
These small changes can accrete over time and have surprisingly powerful positive consequences.

You never know when one of those contributions will result in a breakthrough for them, their family, their community, or an entire industry.

Therefore, treat people like they're absolutely priceless because no one else can contribute and make the world better the way they can.

Including you.
