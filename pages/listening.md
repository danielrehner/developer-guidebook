# Listening is the best thing you can do for someone.

One-on-one conversations are incredibly powerful.

By talking through things with another person, you can make discoveries you simply can't make any other way.
Helping someone make a discovery like that - or making one yourself - is immensely fulfilling.
It can change you.

Go out of your way to talk with people, even when you may not feel like it.

Go out of your way to ask people how they are. Actually wait for a response.

Get past the surface-level talk. Dig deeper. Ask follow-up questions. Care about the answers.

They will feel cared for and valued.

And they will care for and value others.
