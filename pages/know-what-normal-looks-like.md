#Monitoring - know what normal looks like

You will have to look at your application's logs (or other metrics) when things are not working or there is something wrong. Beyond that, though, it is really helpful to take some time to see how the logs and any other metrics look when things are NOT wrong. This gives you a good baseline for how your application behaves and makes it easier for you to get a sense things may be wrong before the problem manifests itself in a way users could notice.
