# Persevere.
```
Anything significant will be harder than you think.

    Keep going.

Anything significant will take longer than you think.

    Be patient with the months and years.

Things will get more challenging.

    Move swiftly through tasks each day.

You will make mistakes.

    Embrace it.

Other people will make mistakes.

    Roll with it.

Never stop doing.

    Never stop learning.

        Never stop producing.

             Never stop improving.

And don't forget: never stop caring.
