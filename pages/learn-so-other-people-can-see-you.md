# Learn so other people can see you.

Be a continual learner.
Moreover, learn in ways people can watch you learn and change.

Seek out people and resources that can teach you how to deal with your exact current challenges better.

Talk with people about what you're learning, what you're trying, what's working for you, and especially what's not.
Have hallway conversations where others can listen.
Discuss things in open forums and chat rooms so everyone can benefit and participate.
Create short video or audio recordings if you need to.

Send emails to your friends and your team about things that seem to be good ideas or useful.
Ask them what they think. Then, really [listen](listening.md) to their answers.

In this way, lots of other people will benefit from your learning.
In turn, those people may learn and share their learning with you.
This kind of positive feedback loop is exactly the kind that creates an excellent culture in your team and an enjoyable, fulfilling life.
