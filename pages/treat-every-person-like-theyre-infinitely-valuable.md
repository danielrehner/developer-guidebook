# Treat every person like they're infinitely valuable. 

Every person is one-of-a-kind.

Every person has unique strengths and weaknesses.

Every person has the capacity to make incredible contributions in at least one area.

You never know when you're looking at the next Albert Einstein or 
When you write a bit of code, it's useful. Code can have far-reaching impact, particularly if you're working on something that is reused by a lot of other people or on a system that helps a large number of users perform an important task.

When you spend time with another person, the value of what they gain from that interaction compounds for the rest of their life.
This value can also be multiplied and compounded exponentially as that person shares it with other people and they share with others and so on.
A single conversation with a single person can end up producing incredible value across a large number of people. 

Believe that everyone knows something you don't, something you need to know to be successful. In the same way, believe that everyone needs to know something you know.
You never know when you'll say something or hear something that will change the course of your life or someone else's.

Believe in people, even when they've made big mistakes.
