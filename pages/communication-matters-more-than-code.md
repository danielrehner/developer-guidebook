# Communication matters more than code.

Creating an excellent app or feature or class or function is a good start.
Then, you have to talk with people about it.
All kinds of people: other developers, designers, testers, your boss, your business leaders, customers, and people who talk to customers.

If you communication isn't crystal clear, even excellent code won't keep you from disappointing customers and stakeholders.

If your code is behaviorally correct, easy to read, beautifully refactored, and has 100% automated test coverage, that's just the cost of entry.
You have to coordinate with and incorporate feedback from anyone in your world who might be interested or care or be affected.

Code, show, listen, repeat.
