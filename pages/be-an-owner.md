# Be an owner.

Here's the one thing you can do to dramatically increase your performance and productivity in less than 5 minutes:

**Change your perspective: choose to think like an owner.**

Don't just be another hired hand.
Think as if the entire project, product, team, and business belongs to you.
Choose to take on the mindset that it's yours.
Treat it as such.

Take initiative.

Watch what's happening in the business and its systems each day.

Check things proactively.

Advocate for technical and business ideas you have.

Act as a steward of the highest order.

Grab responsibility, especially when no one is asking you to.

Then, watch everything about how you operate and what you produce skyrocket.
