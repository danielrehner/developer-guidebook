# Fix things twice.

Fix the customer's problem as expediently as possible.
If you can make a quick code change or data change to alleviate pain for the customer or end user, do so.

Then, go back.
Determine the real cause of the real problem.
Fix the root cause of the problem in this case.

Some people might tell you to apply a root cause analysis tool like the [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) technique:
```
- Why did this problem happen?
- Because of item A.
- Why did item A happen?
- Because sub-issue B.
- Why did sub-issue B happen?
... rinse and repeat about 5 times.
```

What most people don't tell you is the causes of problems are multi-faceted,
so you're likely to find multiple causes and opportunities for improvement at all levels of this analysis:
```
- Why did this problem happen?
- Because of item A,
    and issue B,
    and sub-issue C,
    and development process problem #8,
    and deployment process problem #3,
    and business leadership problem #17,
    and customer #34 was upset,
    and Joey was out last week.
- So, why did all that happen?
- Not even sure where to go from here....
```

Situations like this come up.
It can be daunting.
Break down each sub-problem.
Understand it.
Ask questions.
Maximize what you can learn.
List several possible changes you could make to help improve things and/or avoid this problem in the future.
Then, pick one and focus on implementing it until it sticks.
If you pick more than one, you won't end up doing any of them.

Another thing people don't tell you is that you can't just try to eliminate this particular problem.
You have to think at a higher level and, as far as possible, **also work to eliminate this entire category of problem**.

If the problem was a coding issue, can you automate several static code checks that will completely eliminate the possiblity of this or any other similar problem from occurring again?

If the problem was a process problem, you may have reorganize several pieces of how work flows through your organization to really get it right.

This line of thinking will lead you to take higher-leverage actions that will improve your entire organization.

Be prepared: in the final analysis, it may be that something flawed in you has to change.
