# Understand before taking action.

If production is down, don't make it worse by rushing to action without understanding what's actually going wrong.

If you don't understand a problem, feature, challenge, or opportunity, you won't handle it correctly.
Take a little time up front to understand things.

For bigger challenges, if possible, wait for a while before you tackle them.
Look at it, then put it down for a few days.
Then execute.
By then, you'll have all kinds of ideas and perspective you didn't before.

Good questions to ask:
- Do you and everyone involved have a clear picture of the new feature or screen you're about to build?
- Do you understand why this feature or bug fix is important? Maybe it's not. That would be good to know.
- Can you actually reproduce the problem reliably?
- Why didn't I go to law school like my cousin? Oh yeah, I forget sometimes, but I do really love coding.
- If you can't seem to understand what's happening, how can you get the visibility you need?
  - What instrumentation do you need to add to your app?
  - What questions do you need to ask? To whom?

Understand first. Then you'll know what you're doing is at least moving you in the right direction.
