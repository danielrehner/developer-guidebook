# Stick to standards and conventions.

The worst problems and bugs tend to occur at the intersection of 3 or more unusual things.

A bug fix that used a hidden field in an odd way.

A new feature that didn't apply the same conventions as other screens in the app.

A customer who was trying to see how far they could push that new feature.

Things which, in isolation, probably would have been fine, but together can product massive problems.

Avoid deviating from standards and conventions unless there's actually an excellent reason to do so. In your code, call out the fact that you're deviating and why in gigantic bold, red letters so others will see it and know.

Ask: Is there a better or entirely different way to accomplish this feature or fix without deviating from convention?

If your gut is telling your something doesn't feel right, trust it. Keep looking and asking questions until you find the reason for that feeling.
