# Invest in others, especially when you have no time.

When you write a bit of code, it's useful. Code can have far-reaching impact, particularly if you're working on something that is reused by a lot of other people or on a system that helps a large number of users perform an important task.

When you spend time with another person, the value of what they gain from that interaction compounds for the rest of their life.
This value can also be multiplied and compounded exponentially as that person shares it with other people and they share with others and so on.
A single conversation with a single person can end up producing incredible value across a large number of people. 

When you have no time, that is exactly the time to be spending time with others increasing their capability.
Then, they'll be able to accomplish things, take work off your plate, and give you time back.
Allow people to solve problems in ways they can handle at their current level of capability.
Believe in people and continue to build people up, even and perhaps especially when they've made big mistakes.

Also, believe that everyone knows something you don't, something you need to know to be successful. In the same way, believe that everyone needs to know something you know.
You never know when you'll say something or hear something that will change the course of your life or someone else's.

Treat every person, situation, and conversation like you can learn something important.
